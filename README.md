# The Autonomy Stack

**The Autonomy Stack** is an open, evolving governance operating system that offers a shared framework for designing legitimacy, coordination, and collective agency in a world where old institutions are no longer sufficient.

This repository exists for people who sense that governance matters deeply, yet rarely feels designed with care, imagination, or humility. It is a place to think together about how authority forms, how it holds, and how it might be re-made.

## Why This Exists

Across societies, organizations, and communities, we are living through a widening gap between how systems of authority operate and how people actually experience them.

The Autonomy Stack begins from a simple conviction:  
**governance is something we build, maintain, and revise together.**

Rather than offering answers in advance, this project creates space to explore better questions:
- What makes authority legitimate?
- How do people coordinate without forced agreement?
- How can systems remain coherent while allowing disagreement, dissent, and change?

## How We Think About Governance

The Autonomy Stack treats governance as a form of design.

- **Layered and modular**  
  Authority is shaped by many interacting components—rules, norms, tools, narratives, and practices—rather than a single structure.

- **Iterative and adaptive**  
  Systems earn their credibility through use, revision, and responsiveness over time.

- **Rooted in lived experience**  
  Legitimacy emerges when people recognize themselves in the systems they participate in.

- **Capable of holding disagreement**  
  Durable governance does not require uniform belief, only enough shared structure to act together.

## What You’ll Find Here

This repository is both a workshop and a record.

- `/stack/`  
  The conceptual core of the Autonomy Stack. These documents develop the architecture, principles, and design ethic of the governance OS.

  - `00-overview.md` — The current high-level framing and vision

Additional materials will emerge as the project grows and is tested against real conditions.

## How to Engage

This work is meant to be read slowly and revisited often.

You are invited to:
- explore ideas without needing immediate conclusions
- contribute thoughts, critiques, and extensions
- treat uncertainty as a feature, not a flaw
- help shape something that none of us could design alone

## Project Status

The Autonomy Stack is alive, unfinished, and deliberately open. Its value lies not in arriving at certainty, but in cultivating clarity, shared language, and the capacity to act together under conditions of uncertainty.

*If authority shapes our lives,  
then designing it is a responsibility worth taking seriously.*
