# v0.2

Reframed the Autonomy Stack as a governance operating system and reference architecture, clarifying its role as a shared logic for coordination rather than a blueprint or policy program.

Shifted from a hierarchical reading of layers to layers as reference axes, enabling multi-dimensional analysis without prescribed sequencing or priority.

Restored and clarified the project’s core purpose: advancing autonomy through better governance systems that connect rather than colonize.

Reworked structure and language to emphasize orientation, motion, and interdependence, replacing static or defensive framing.

Integrated patterns, signals, and modules as complementary instruments within the same reference frame.

Stabilized conceptual scope by deferring how-to guidance, implementation detail, and adoption mechanics to future versions.

v0.2 marks the transition from exploratory assembly to a coherent, emotionally grounded operating logic that can support future growth without premature hardening.
