# Principles

**The Autonomy Stack (v0.1)**

These principles constrain all design work undertaken as part of the Autonomy Stack.
They are not values, aspirations, or goals.
They are **limits**.

Violating a principle may sometimes be expedient.
Doing so should always be explicit, documented, and treated as a failure condition.

---

## 1. Authority Must Be Contestable

No decision, role, mechanism, or structure may be beyond meaningful challenge.

Designs that rely on unchallengeable authority—whether technical, institutional, moral, or procedural—are considered illegitimate by default.

Contestability must be practical, not symbolic.

---

## 2. Power Without Legibility Is Unacceptable

No actor or mechanism may exercise power over others without being understandable to those affected.

Complexity does not excuse opacity.
Interfaces do not substitute for understanding.

If power cannot be explained, it cannot be justified.

---

## 3. Disagreement Is a Design Condition

Persistent disagreement is assumed.

Designs must function without consensus, alignment, or shared values.
Systems that require harmony to operate are considered fragile.

Conflict avoidance is not treated as success.

---

## 4. Resilience Takes Priority Over Elegance

Designs are evaluated under stress, misuse, partial failure, and adversarial conditions.

Robustness is favored over optimization.
Graceful degradation is favored over maximal performance.

Elegance that collapses under pressure is a design failure.

---

## 5. Legibility Takes Priority Over Expertise

No system may depend on credentialed expertise as a prerequisite for participation or accountability.

Expertise may inform design, but it must remain contestable, explainable, and subordinate to legibility.

Authority derived solely from expertise is insufficient.

---

## 6. Opaque Mechanisms Require Extraordinary Justification

Black-box mechanisms are presumed illegitimate.

Opacity must be justified explicitly, narrowly, and temporarily.
Convenience, efficiency, or proprietary interest do not constitute sufficient justification.

Unexamined opacity is treated as a form of power concentration.

---

## 7. Failure Is Informative

Failure, misuse, and breakdown are treated as signals.

Designs that suppress, obscure, or rationalize failure are considered incomplete.

Learning requires visibility of error.

---

## 8. Nothing Is Final

All structures are provisional.

No design is treated as complete, permanent, or beyond revision.
Durability is not mistaken for legitimacy.

Finality is treated as a warning sign.

---

### Status

This document represents **v0.1**.

These principles are expected to be tested, strained, and contested.
Revisions must strengthen constraints, not soften them.
