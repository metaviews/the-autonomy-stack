# Signals

Signals are short orientation artifacts.

They do not record decisions, progress, or outcomes.
They surface what is becoming visible, salient, or uncertain in the moment.

Signals exist to help humans and automated systems maintain situational awareness as the Autonomy Stack evolves.

## What a Signal Is

A Signal captures:

* a shift in attention
* an emerging tension
* a clarification of intent
* a newly visible assumption
* a pattern beginning to take shape

Signals illuminate context.
They do not resolve it.

## Why Signals Exist

The Autonomy Stack is designed to be legible to both humans and automated systems.

Signals provide a lightweight, non-authoritative way to:

* reduce drift
* document evolving orientation
* mark moments of conceptual importance
* note changes in thinking or approach

They allow the project to think out loud without hardening prematurely.

## Relationship to Other Artifacts

* **Signals → Patterns**
  Repeated or enduring signals may eventually be stabilized as patterns.

* **Signals ↔ STATE**
  STATE summarizes the current posture; signals are the live inputs that shape it.


## How to Read Signals

* Read them as orientation markers, not instructions.
* Expect ambiguity.
* Look for recurrence and resonance over time.

## Naming and Format

Signals are:

* short (usually under 200 words)
* written in plain language
* timestamped
* minimally structured

Consistency matters more than completeness.

## When to Create a Signal

Create a signal when:

* an assumption becomes visible
* a metaphor starts to strain
* a tension sharpens
* an insight recurs across contexts
* something feels important but not yet clear

If it feels premature to formalize, it probably belongs here.

Signals are living artifacts.
They may age, fade, or be superseded without ceremony.
