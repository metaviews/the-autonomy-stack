### Observation

Digital platforms increasingly function as de facto governance layers. Through moderation rules, ranking algorithms, access controls, and interface design, platforms now shape what can be said, seen, organized, and sustained—often more directly than formal political institutions.

This authority is exercised continuously, infrastructurally, and without the symbolic rituals traditionally associated with governance.

---

### Why This Matters

If platforms are governance layers, then power is being exercised outside democratic visibility and accountability. Treating platforms as neutral infrastructure obscures how coordination, legitimacy, and exclusion are actually being produced.

### Open Texture

It remains unclear how legitimacy can be contested or reclaimed when governance is embedded in private, adaptive systems rather than explicit rules or offices.
