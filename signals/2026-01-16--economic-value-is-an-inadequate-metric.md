### Observation

Economic value is routinely used as a proxy for importance, efficiency, and success. In practice, many of the dynamics that sustain authority—care, legitimacy, resilience, coordination, and trust withdrawal—are poorly captured or entirely invisible to price-based metrics.

As a result, systems optimized for economic value often undermine the very conditions that allow them to function over time.

### Why This Matters

If economic value is treated as the primary metric, design choices will consistently favor extraction over durability and efficiency over legitimacy. This distorts both governance and technological systems, especially when metrics are automated and scaled.

### Open Texture

It remains unclear what alternative metrics can guide coordination at scale without reproducing the same blind spots under a different name.
