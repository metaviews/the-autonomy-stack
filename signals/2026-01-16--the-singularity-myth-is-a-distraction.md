### Observation

Speculative narratives about technological singularities frame authority as something that will arrive suddenly through runaway intelligence or total automation. These narratives divert attention from the incremental, mundane, and already-operational systems through which power is currently exercised.

By focusing on hypothetical futures, the singularity myth simplifies complex present dynamics into a single imagined rupture.

### Why This Matters

When attention is captured by distant scenarios, existing systems of control, dependency, and legitimacy escape scrutiny. This weakens accountability in the present and narrows the range of actionable responses.

### Open Texture

It remains an open question why singularity narratives retain such influence despite repeated failures to account for real-world power structures.
