# Pattern: Hybrid War

## Summary
A mode of conflict that degrades authority and coherence across multiple domains without crossing formal thresholds of war.

## Core Dynamic
Pressure is distributed across political, economic, media, legal, and cultural systems to produce paralysis, confusion, and self-discipline.

## Signals
- Simultaneous disruption across unrelated domains
- Persistent ambiguity about intent or responsibility
- Institutions freeze rather than respond
- Widespread self-censorship or pre-emptive compliance

## What It Targets
Legitimacy, institutional confidence, and collective sense-making.

## Why It Works
It exploits procedural norms, slow institutional response times, and the assumption of good faith.

## Common Misreadings
- “This is just politics / media / markets”
- “There’s no proof of intent”
- “Nothing illegal happened”

## Related Patterns
- Legitimacy Drift
- Strategic Ambiguity
- Platform Capture
- Obedience in Advance
