# Patterns

## What This Directory Is

The **Patterns** directory is the interpretive layer of the Autonomy Stack.

It contains documented patterns that have *emerged from practice* and debate. These patterns describe recurring dynamics, solutions, tensions, and design logics observed across governance, technology, media, agroecology, and political economy.

Patterns are not rules. They are not mandates. They are *recognitions*.

They exist to help others:

* See what tends to recur
* Understand why certain approaches fail or succeed
* Compose their own systems using lessons already learned

## Relationship to *Future of Authority*

The **Future of Authority** newsletter functions as the primary workshop, laboratory, and stress‑testing environment for the Autonomy Stack.

Most patterns documented here:

* Were first explored publicly through essays, issues, and reader dialogue
* Were refined through critique, disagreement, and iteration

In this sense:

* *Future of Authority* is where patterns are **discovered**
* This repository is where patterns are **distilled**

No pattern appears here unless it has been tested in the open.

## What a Pattern Is

A pattern typically includes:

* A name that captures a recurring phenomenon
* The context in which the pattern appears
* The forces or tensions that produce it
* The consequences of engaging with (or ignoring) it
* Examples or references, often pointing back to newsletter issues

Patterns may overlap. They may conflict. They may evolve.
Pluralism is treated as a feature, not a flaw.

## Change and Revision

Patterns are living documents.

They may be:

* Expanded as new evidence emerges
* Clarified as language improves
* Superseded by better formulations

Older versions are not erased. They remain as part of the project’s intellectual lineage.

## Relationship to the Stack

If the **Autonomy Stack** describes *what is being assembled*,

then **Patterns** describe *how similar systems have actually behaved in the world*.

They are the connective tissue between theory and practice.
