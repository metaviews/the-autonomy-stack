# Pattern: Temporal Capture

## Summary
The future is endlessly promised while present conditions deteriorate, delaying accountability and suppressing action.

## Core Dynamic
Attention is redirected from present failure to speculative futures, keeping authority insulated from evaluation.

## Signals
- Grand future-oriented narratives amid worsening current conditions
- Calls for patience framed as responsibility
- Permanent pilots, transitions, or “early stages”
- Criticism dismissed as premature or anti-progress

## What It Targets
Accountability, urgency, and collective capacity to act in the present.

## Why It Works
People are culturally trained to tolerate present harm in exchange for promised future benefit.

## Common Misreadings
- “This is just long-term planning”
- “Change takes time”
- “You don’t understand the roadmap”

## Related Patterns

- Algorithmic Authority
