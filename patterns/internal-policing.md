# Pattern: Internalized Policing

## Summary
Social norms and enforcement are crowdsourced to peers, reducing the need for overt institutional coercion.

## Core Dynamic
Power operates by encouraging people to monitor, correct, and punish one another.

## Signals
- Public shaming replacing formal enforcement
- Rules enforced unevenly through social pressure
- Fear of reputational damage outweighing legal risk
- Communities fragmenting over norm compliance

## What It Targets
Solidarity, dissent, and the ability to coordinate resistance.

## Why It Works
It converts social belonging into a mechanism of control and distributes enforcement costs.

## Common Misreadings
- “This is just accountability”
- “People are choosing to enforce norms”
- “There’s no coercion involved”

## Related Patterns
- Obedience in Advance
- Platform Capture
- Manufactured Ambiguity
