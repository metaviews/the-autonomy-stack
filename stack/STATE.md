# STATE

*This file captures the current posture of the Autonomy Stack. It is an orientation snapshot: what is stable enough to rely on, what is active and alive, what is unresolved, and what we are deliberately not deciding yet.*

---

## Purpose

STATE is not a changelog, roadmap, or decision register.

It exists to help both humans and automated systems quickly answer:

* What matters right now?
* What assumptions are currently in play?
* What is settled enough to build on?
* What remains intentionally open?

STATE is revised when orientation changes—not on a schedule.

## Stable Ground (true enough to rely on)

* **Patterns are the translation layer.** Insights emerge in narrative form (newsletter, analysis) and are translated into reusable abstractions via patterns.
* **The OS metaphor is intentional.** It is used because the work is meant to be encountered by both humans and automated systems.
* **Legitimacy is central.** The project is concerned with how coordination becomes accepted, contested, or withdrawn.
* **Design precedes authority.** Coherence is pursued before governance.

## Active Signals (currently shaping direction)

* **Dual-use audience is a core constraint.** Artifacts must be legible to humans and parseable by machines without implying hierarchy or command.
* **Patterns over decisions.** We are explicitly not operating a formal decision-making process; records should illuminate context, not justify outcomes.
* **Orientation over resolution.** The system values situational awareness and posture rather than closure.
* **Narrative → Pattern → Stack flow.** Movement from insight to abstraction to coordination is directional but non-linear.

## Tensions We Are Sitting With

* **OS metaphor vs accessibility.** How far technical language can go without excluding non-technical readers.
* **Structure vs openness.** Creating enough form to be legible to systems without hardening into bureaucracy.
* **Stability vs liveliness.** Freezing insight too early risks losing nuance; waiting too long risks incoherence.

These tensions are not problems to solve, but conditions to design with.

## How to Read This File

* Treat it as a compass, not a contract.
* Expect it to change.
* Use it to orient new work and new readers.
