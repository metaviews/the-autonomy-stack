# STATE

This file captures the current state of the Autonomy Stack as a living system.

It is intended as a point of orientation for both human readers and automated systems encountering the project in motion. It does not describe decisions, progress, or completion. Instead, it reflects what is presently stable, what is actively forming, and what remains intentionally unresolved.

---

## Current Orientation

The project is presently focused on translating narrative and analytical insights from *Future of Authority* into reusable, legible patterns that can inform a governance operating system without presuming authority, hierarchy, or enforcement.

Attention is concentrated on clarity of language, accessibility across audiences, and the careful use of technical metaphors without allowing those metaphors to dominate or exclude.

---

## Stable Patterns

The following patterns are currently considered sufficiently formed to serve as structural reference points:

- **Patterns as Translation Layer**  
  Patterns function as the bridge between narrative insight and operational design, allowing ideas to be reused without being frozen into rules or decisions.

- **Operating System as Metaphor, Not Mechanism**  
  The “OS” framing is used to describe coordination, legitimacy, and interaction, not control or execution.

- **Dual-Use Legibility**  
  Artifacts are designed to be intelligible to humans while remaining structured enough to be parsed by automated systems.

## Active Tensions

The following tensions are present and unresolved, and are being held deliberately:

- The balance between technical metaphors and plain language accessibility  
- The desire for machine legibility without encouraging bureaucratic or authoritarian interpretations  
- The role of memory and record-keeping without implying decision-making authority or linear progress  

These tensions are treated as generative rather than problematic.

## Reading Change Over Time

This file is updated periodically to reflect shifts in orientation or stability. Changes should be read as changes in attention or understanding, not as milestones or progress indicators.

Historical context is preserved through version control rather than explicit narration.
