# The Autonomy Stack — v0.2

## A Governance Operating System for a World in Motion

The Autonomy Stack begins from a simple recognition: governance must operate in conditions of continuous change.

Food systems, energy systems, media systems, care systems, and decision systems evolve at different speeds, under different pressures, and with different failure modes. When governance treats these domains as static or separable, coordination breaks down. Decisions made in one domain generate unintended consequences in others.

The Autonomy Stack approaches this reality as an **operating system**.

Not software, but governance software: a shared logic for how systems relate, how authority is exercised, how failures propagate, and how autonomy is preserved amid constant motion.

Its purpose is to make autonomy—individual and collective—more achievable by improving how governance systems coordinate *without subsuming one another*. The Stack aligns systems so that power remains contestable and responsibility remains visible, even as conditions shift.

v0.2 reflects a maturation of this intent. The work shifts from assembling concepts to stabilizing the operating logic that connects them.

## The Stack as a Reference Architecture

The Autonomy Stack is a **reference architecture for governance in contested conditions**.

It provides a way to think across systems that are normally designed, regulated, and debated in isolation. Rather than offering solutions or prescriptions, it creates a shared frame for understanding how different forms of governance interact—and how autonomy is either supported or undermined by those interactions.

As a reference architecture, the Stack helps:

* locate where governance breakdowns are occurring,
* understand how failures in one domain propagate into others,
* compare situations without assuming a single metric of success,
* design responses that connect systems instead of overriding them.

The Stack is meant to be lived with over time. Its value increases as it is returned to, tested against reality, and used to notice what had previously gone unseen.

## How the Stack Works

The Autonomy Stack is organized into **layers**, understood in v0.2 as **reference axes**.

Each layer highlights a different dimension of governance. Any real-world situation can be examined across all layers at once. There is no correct entry point. Attention can begin wherever tension, breakdown, or possibility is most visible.

Because the layers are interdependent:

* stress in one layer reshapes conditions in others,
* resilience in one layer can compensate for fragility elsewhere,
* distortions tend to travel, not remain contained.

Reading the Stack is an act of orientation. It is a way of staying with complexity long enough to see how systems connect rather than treating symptoms in isolation.

## The Layers

### Layer 1: Material Base (Infrastructure)

This layer asks: *can people live at all?*

Food, energy, housing, logistics, and environmental systems form the metabolic base of society. When this base becomes insecure, every other layer becomes harder to sustain, easier to coerce, and more vulnerable to shock.

Food Power is the most developed area of work here, because food is both unavoidable and highly revealing: it connects biology, ecology, culture, and political economy.

---

### Layer 2: Commons & Institutions

This layer asks: *who takes responsibility together?*

Commons and institutions are the durable containers of shared obligation. Co-operatives, unions, municipalities, mutual aid networks, public agencies, and standards bodies belong here.

This layer clarifies the difference between coordination and responsibility. Systems can coordinate through platforms while responsibility evaporates. Institutions endure when obligation remains real, enforceable, and shared.

---

### Layer 3: Legibility & Metrics

This layer asks: *what counts?*

What systems can see, measure, and respond to becomes what they value. Metrics shape behavior, attention, and legitimacy.

Post-market metrics work belongs here as a struggle over visibility: what society is allowed to measure, what it can meaningfully compare, and what it can defend without reducing life to output.

---

### Layer 4: Decision Systems & Authority

This layer asks: *how do decisions become binding?*

Law, norms, procurement rules, algorithms, and administrative processes live here. This is where power becomes operational.

This layer emphasizes contestability: decisions that affect people require explanation, appeal, and revision pathways. Algorithmic authority matters here because it scales binding decisions while reshaping who can question them.

---

### Layer 5: Knowledge & Intelligence

This layer asks: *what do we think is happening?*

Research, media, public inquiry, and shared situational awareness shape collective reality. This layer sustains productive disagreement and enables coordination without forced consensus.

In contested environments, disinformation and fragmentation function as strategic pressures on governance. Research appears here as resistance because maintaining shared reality is itself a form of defense.

---

### Layer 6: Human Capacity & Care

This layer asks: *can people keep going?*

Care systems, disability and neurodivergence inclusion, education-as-literacy, and labor conditions define the human operating limits of any system.

Burnout, withdrawal, and resentment function as system signals. This layer sets the ceiling on complexity, adaptability, and resilience.

---

## Patterns, Signals, and Modules

The Autonomy Stack uses multiple instruments to observe the same terrain:

* **Layers** orient attention across structural dimensions.
* **Patterns** describe recurring dynamics that appear across contexts.
* **Signals** surface early indications of stress, shift, or opening.
* **Modules** name areas where the frame has been explored deeply enough to support structured experimentation.

Together they create a vocabulary for diagnosis, sensemaking, and design.

---

## Legitimacy

Legitimacy is an emergent property of conditions across the Stack.

In different situations it appears as consent, endurance, refusal, compliance, exit, or withdrawal. The Stack treats legitimacy as something to be observed and explained—an outcome of interacting layers rather than a premise.

---

## What v0.2 Emphasizes

v0.2 establishes the Stack as a reference architecture and clarifies how its parts relate.

Its focus is:

* layers as reference axes,
* interdependence and propagation,
* patterns and signals as complementary instruments,
* modules as a later stage of maturation.

This keeps the Stack open, legible, and extensible.

---

## A Proceeding Constraint

Future work belongs in the Autonomy Stack when it clarifies how autonomy is sustained, constrained, or lost under complex and contested conditions.

This constraint protects coherence as the project grows.

---

## Version Note

v0.2 marks the transition from assembling ideas to establishing shared orientation. It tightens definitions, strengthens the reference-frame approach, and sets the conditions for later modules and policies to emerge without hardening too early.
